# Mapping Earthquakes with JS & APIs

## Objectives and Overview of the Project:

In this module we created several branches of the main branch. We added, committed, and pushed the data on GitHub branch and then merged the branch with main branch on GitHub. We also learnt to retrieved the data by making requests to a server with USGS API, as GeoJSON file. 
We populated the GeoJSON data on geographical maps using JavaScript and the Data-Driven Documents (D3) library. We created interactive maps of earthquakes and tectonic plates with multiple layers to the maps using  Leaflet control plugins. 

## Resources

•	Data Source: Earthquakes GeoJSON, Tectonic Plate GeoJSON

•	HTML/CSS, JavaScript Studio Code, Leaflet.js, D3.js 6.2.0

## Results

1.	Added the tectonic plate data and create the tectonic plate layer.

2.	Added major earthquake data. Added the color and radius of circle markers in relation to the magnitude of the earthquake. Also added popup marker for each earthquake displaying the magnitude and location of the earthquake.
